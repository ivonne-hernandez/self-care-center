Self Care Center is an application that generates random affirmation and mantra messages. Users can create their own message by clicking on the "Add Message" button. Users also have the ability to delete a message by clicking on the "I don't like this message button" or clearing the message all together by clicking on the "Clear" button.


#### How to Use the App:
- Go to [Self Care Center](https://ivonne-hernandez.github.io/self-care-center/)

- The main page asks the user to select a type of message (affirmation or mantra) and click on the "Receive Message" button in order to view a message.

- If the user doesn't like the message they can click on the "I don't like this message" button to delete it and remove it from the list of available messages. They can also clear the message from view.

- If the user would prefer to add their own message, they can click on the "Add Message" button and input their message in the input box provided. Upon submitting their affirmation or mantra, their message will be displayed.
